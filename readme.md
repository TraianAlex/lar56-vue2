# Laravel PHP Framework with Vue :shipit:

## The Gibberish 
This is vue playground project for random vue things. I followed  [The Laracast](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/)
 series on Vue 2.0. After every episode I tried to implement the given
  knowledge with humor and in non-sense convention. This project is literally
   stuffed with non-sense Vue components, they serve no purpose but just
    to how they work themselves. You invite you to clone this project 
    and see yourself how Vue can be easy and powerful. 
    
   Obviously,
     if you reallyWantToLearnVue I strongly recommend to do such a project
      yourself and share your work online with others. You can even link 
      this project in issues of that one - we can always make it easier for ourselves 
      to learn and develop. 
## Checking out
If you want to install this project locally, clone it anf follow:  Run -- `composer install` --- then,
---`npm install`---, and finally ----`npm run dev`--- or ---`npm run watch`---.

Remember to migrate the database by `php artisan migrate`

I recommend using [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/valet) or [Vagrant](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead), as these tools are the easiest to learn and the
 fastest to develop projects locally on a small scale.

**Have fun and**
**keep in mind this is vue project mostly. :+1:**
